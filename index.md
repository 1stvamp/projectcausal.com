About
-----
Causal is a project to bring together all your social services together in one place.

Causal gives you two ways to view your social history. The first is a web interface displaying 
your past 7 days of the enabled services. The second is a json feed of the same data of all your
updates in a standardised format. 

We have made the decision to open the project to drive the project in a direction users want
rather than any whims we might have.
